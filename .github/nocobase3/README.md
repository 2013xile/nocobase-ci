# NocoBase 3 Pro CI relay

`nocobase3-pro-ci.yml` is dispatched by `nocobase-bot` with seven string inputs: `request_id`, `event_name`, `head_sha`, `base_sha`, `target_branch`, `pr_number`, and `skip_label`. Its run name is `pro-ci:<request_id>`, which lets the bot associate the public workflow run with check runs on `nocobase/nocobase3-pro`.

The job names form a bot-facing protocol and must remain exact: `Submodule and catalog`, `Changed files`, `Typecheck`, `Test`, `Build`, `Pro plugins on OSS Default installation smoke test`, `quality`, `Validate and advise`, and `Reject prerelease state`. `Validate and advise` applies only to pull requests targeting `main` or `develop`; `Reject prerelease state` applies only to pull requests targeting `main`.

The workflow checks out only the supplied immutable commits. Quality and main-guard jobs locally merge the fixed base and head and fail on conflicts, while the changeset job checks the fixed pull request head against the fixed base. It never fetches a movable Pro branch for execution.

The existing GitHub App credentials create an installation token restricted to `nocobase/nocobase3-pro` with read-only contents permission. Checkout does not persist credentials, and the token is always revoked before dependency installation or any Pro script runs. The public repository token has read-only contents permission. No package publishing, deployment, or notification secrets are provided to this workflow.

Logs are public by design, but the workflow does not upload source, packages, logs, diagnostic artifacts, or caches. The create-app smoke test publishes only to an ephemeral registry on its isolated runner.

Run the committed contract and Git fixture tests with:

```bash
node --test .github/nocobase3/tests/*.test.mjs
```

Lint the workflow with:

```bash
go run github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint@v1.7.7 -color=false .github/workflows/nocobase3-pro-ci.yml
```
